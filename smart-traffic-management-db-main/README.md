# Smart Traffic Management Database
This project deals with the theoretical design and construction of a **database** of a proposed application. The application concerns *traffic management* in a *smart city*. A *smart city* is a technologically modern urban area that uses different types of electronic methods, voice activation methods and sensors to collect specific data. That data is used to improve the operations across the city, such as traffic management.
The purpose of the application is to match each vehicle with the fastest feasible route in order to reach the desirable destination and
help the drivers to locate available parking slots easier. Also, it aims to detect traffic violations and store them.
