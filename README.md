# ðŸš¦ Smart-Traffic-Management-Database/Application

## Description
This project focuses on the theoretical design and construction of a database for a traffic management application in a smart city. The proposed application utilizes various electronic methods, voice activation methods, and sensors to collect specific data, aiming to improve traffic operations and management in the city.

The main objectives of the application are:
- Matching each vehicle with the fastest feasible route to their desired destination.
- Assisting drivers in locating available parking slots more efficiently.
- Detecting and storing traffic violations for further analysis and enforcement.

A smart city is a technologically advanced urban area that leverages data collection and analysis to enhance various aspects of city operations, including traffic management.

## Repository
The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/christos99/smart-traffic-management-database).

## Database Design
The database design for the application includes:
- Theoretical design and construction of the database.
- Entity-Relationship (ER) model to represent entities and their relationships.
- Relational model for defining tables and attributes.
- Examples demonstrating the database's functionality.

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:
1. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries.
2. Configure the electronic methods, voice activation methods, and sensors to collect relevant data.
3. Connect the application to the smart city infrastructure for data integration.
4. Run the application and start collecting data for traffic management purposes.
5. Utilize the application's features to match vehicles with optimal routes, assist in finding parking slots, and detect traffic violations.
